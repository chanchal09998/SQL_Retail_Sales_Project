# ðŸ›’ Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a **Retail Sales dataset** using **SQL**.  
The dataset contains transaction-level data, including customer demographics, sales details, and product categories.  
The goal is to clean, explore, and analyze the dataset to derive meaningful business insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset `retail_sales` contains the following columns:

- `transaction_id` (Primary Key)  
- `sale_date` (Date of transaction)  
- `sale_time` (Time of transaction)  
- `customer_id` (Unique ID for customer)  
- `gender` (Customer gender)  
- `age` (Customer age)  
- `category` (Product category)  
- `quantity` (Number of items purchased)  
- `price_per_unit` (Price per item)  
- `cogs` (Cost of goods sold)  
- `total_sale` (Total sale value)

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Checked for **NULL values** across all columns.  
- Removed transactions with missing data to ensure data consistency.

```sql
select * from retail_sales
where transaction_id is null
   or sale_date is null
   or sale_time is null
   or customer_id is null
   or gender is null
   or age is null
   or category is null
   or price_per_unit is null
   or cogs is null
   or total_sale is null
   or quantity is null;

delete from retail_sales
where transaction_id is null
   or sale_date is null
   or sale_time is null
   or customer_id is null
   or gender is null
   or age is null
   or category is null
   or price_per_unit is null
   or cogs is null
   or total_sale is null
   or quantity is null;


## ðŸ“Š Data Exploration

Total number of sales transactions  
```sql
select count(*) as totl_sales_count from retail_sales;
```

Total number of unique customers  
```sql
select count(distinct customer_id) as no_of_customer from retail_sales;
```

Number of unique categories  
```sql
select count(distinct category) as total_categories from retail_sales;
```
